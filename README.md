The only feasible way you'd get here is if you came from discord, so thanks I guess.

## My goal for the project

The endgame for this project is a working IDE with the
following features.

- A heavily data-oriented design for easy modification 
- A feature-rich backend powered by [SharpEye](https://github.com/zeplar-exe/SharpEye)
- General ease-of-use for a user or developer wishing to extend this project (or just use it as reference).
- A desktop application usable for day-to-day development for most programming languages.
- A reliable plugin API

A bit ambitious, yes, but I might as well go insane from COVID otherwise.

## Configuration 

 Handled by SettingsConfig, a [package](#) I've uploaded to nuget and updated accordingly for my needs.

SettingsConfig is the core of the app's functionality. The syntax is simple in using `a=bcd` formatting.

As of writing this, SettingsConfig supports signed doubles, boolean, strings, and nesting.
